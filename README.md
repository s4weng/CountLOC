# countLOC
Python script to count lines of code in a project.

--help for commands\n
--ext .ext1 .ext2 ... etc. to set type of files to count LOC for\n
--path pathdirectory to set path

Default is to search all subdirectories starting from current, for all files.
(Note that this includes non-text files, meaning images will be parsed which may lead to "incorrect" count.)

Please let me know of any bugs.
